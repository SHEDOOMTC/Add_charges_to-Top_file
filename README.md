# Add_charges_to_Top_file
I describe a seamless way to include charges from QM calculations into the top file of your ligand

After ligand parametrization using Molecular mechanics forcefields, the partial atomic chrges needs to be fine-tuned using quantum mechanics calculations (Gaussian, DFT etc)

Herein is a code to help you edit the top file with the calculated partial chrges
